# Template
This is a repo I use when starting out new websites. I always use tailwind and angular so this saves some of the somewhat cumbersome setup. Note that there is no style/content to this template, it's just the bones, configs, etc.

To set this repo up with a new name:
  git clone https://github.com/CharliePalm/TailwindTemplate
  mv TailwindTemplate {{new name}}
  npm run setup --name={{new name}}
